- Postman collection and testing guide created
- 31,000+ words of production documentation across `docs/`

---

## Implemented Flows

All flows are documented with Mermaid diagrams in [`docs/arquitectura/diagrams/`](../arquitectura/diagrams/).

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ User registration (email + password, BCrypt hashing)
- ✅ Login → JWT access token (24h) + refresh token (7d)
- ✅ Token refresh
- ✅ Authenticated request via API Gateway (JWT validation → X-User-Id / X-User-Roles injection)
- ✅ RBAC enforcement via `@RequiresRole` (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_PROFESSIONAL`, `ROLE_ADMIN`)

### Training
- ✅ Browse system exercise catalog (public, paginated)
- ✅ Browse exercises by discipline (public, paginated)
- ✅ Create / update / delete custom exercises (owner-only)
- ✅ Browse system routine templates (public, paginated)
- ✅ Create custom routine templates
- ✅ Assign routine template to user
- ✅ Deactivate user routine
- ✅ Log exercise sessions (sets, reps, weight, duration)
- ✅ Query session history by routine or date

### Tracking
- ✅ Create custom measurement types
- ✅ Record body measurements over time
- ✅ Query measurement history by type
- ✅ Create fitness objectives
- ✅ Create diet & training plans with components
- ✅ Log daily diet entries
- ✅ Create and retrieve recommendations

### Notifications
- ✅ Create in-app notifications
- ✅ Deliver push notifications via Firebase FCM
- ✅ List / read / delete notifications
- ✅ Mark notifications as read
- ✅ Get unread count
- ✅ Register / deactivate push tokens (Android & iOS)
- ✅ Manage notification preferences per user

---

## Upcoming Flows

Flows not yet implemented, ordered by priority.

### High Priority
- ⬜ Email verification on registration (token sent, link clicked)
- ⬜ Trainer assigns routine/plan to a client user
- ⬜ Automatic notification triggered on session logged or goal achieved

### Medium Priority
- ⬜ Progress analytics — strength trends, personal bests, volume over time
- ⬜ Recommendation engine — auto-generate recommendations based on tracking data
- ⬜ Plan templates — reusable diet/training plan templates
- ⬜ Scheduled push notifications (workout reminders, check-ins)
- ⬜ Pagination cursor-based (replace offset for large datasets)

### Future / Aspirational
- ⬜ Flutter mobile client — full auth + training + tracking + notification flows
- ⬜ Web dashboard — admin panel, analytics, user management
- ⬜ Social features — challenges, leaderboards, community feed
- ⬜ Payment & subscription flow (premium tiers)
- ⬜ CI/CD pipeline — automated build, test, deploy on push
- ⬜ Observability — Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, ELK logs

## Future Phases (Not Started)

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Flutter mobile app | iOS/Android client |
| Web dashboard | React/Vue frontend |
| Advanced analytics | Progress tracking, ML recommendations |
